## Description
The Antisocial Social Network application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list.  It employed a MongoDB database for storage, and Mongoose ODM. Express.js for routing and the JavaScript Date object was used to format timestamps. Insomnia must be used to utilize and manipulate the database. 
## Deployed Application URL
There is no Url. The api must be cloned from the github repository located at https://github.com/Boilermaker74/The-Anitsocial-Social-Network-API. The api can be utilized via the insomnia design tool.
